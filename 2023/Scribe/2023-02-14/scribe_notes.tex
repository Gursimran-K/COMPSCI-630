\section{Register Allocation}
Register allocation is a key problem in designing compilers. Registers are a limited super fast resources. 
\subsubsection*{Example:}
Operations on Registers (A, B) \\
ADD EAX, EBX, ECX, $C \leftarrow A+B$


In the following example, we can see that the limitation of register might affect the performance.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++]
    void do_something(){
        int a,b,c; \\Can fit in registers
        float x,y,z; \\Can fit in registers
        float arr[1024]; \\Cannot fir in registers (may be even cache memory)
    }
\end{lstlisting}
Registers usally are accessed with ~1~Cycle. However, the L0 Cache require 5--7 Cycles.
\subsection{Complier Role in Register Allocation}
Compliers play an important role in Register Allocation optimizations by trying to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify Live Variables. i.e. Identifying the start and the end of each variable usage.
    \item Maximize number of variables over time
    \item Minimize ``Spills''. Spills is moving data out of memory.
\end{enumerate}
The Register Allocation problem is reducible to graph coloring. i.e., NP-Complete. However, even if there exist a polynomial time algorithm, the process is still too slow especially for JIT compilers.

\subsection{Just In Time (JIT) Compilation}
JIT is a background compilation, on demand, for hot code. JIT uses a compiler and an interpreter. Java used a hot spot JVM method.

Checkout: \url{https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com/}


\noindent{\bf Solution}
The register allocation process requires expensive analysis. They very difficult to use in large code bases and for JITs. The solutions usually use greedy heuristics, which often try to reduce register pressure.


\subsubsection*{Note:}
Web Assembly: The authors of webassembly tried to solve thread management by didicating a register for thread location data and garpage colection through dedicating a register to the root (Pointer to root). The solution created a register pressure that made webassembly 30\% slower than native.


The following figure explains the mark-sweep GC technique as well as how webassembly utilized the register.

\section{FORTRAN is Alive!}
\subsubsection*{Note:}
APL introduced the notations for list comperhension \\
    arr = [x * x for x in range(100)] \\
    Created by kenneth iverson in IBM and APL stands for "Array Programming Language"

FORTRAN is very influential as it allows for automatic parallelization.
FORTRAN allows parallelizing loops. FORTRAN is used in {\it NUMPY} which depends on BLAS "Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms" and LPACK "Linear Algebra PACKAGE".  
\subsubsection*{Note:}
The automatic ability to parallize code in FORTRAN made code written in FORTRAN faster that C. Ex: After translating code from FORTRAN to C using F2C library it became 20-40\% slowdown.  

Languages like c/c++ is only able to parallelize code using special constructs and libraries like Multiple Threads, MPI, OpenMP, etc.

\subsection{Why FORTRAN Allows for automatic parallelization?}
Same argument allows for SQL.
\subsubsection*{Note:}
What is turing compelete? A language that can be used to program any problem, at least in theory.\\
Non-Turing Complete Languages: SQL, Excel, Datalog, regex, ..\\
Turing Complete Langues: All general purpose programming languages \\
Most Domain Specific languages are not turing Complete. \\
Turing Completeness can be achived by simple constructs.\\

\subsubsection*{Example:}
Read Tape, Write 0, Write 1. \\
If R0 go left, if not R0 go right, If R1 go left, If not R1 go right.


\subsubsection*{Note:}
Low-level languages are hard to optimize as the intent is not clear.\\
High-level language are easier to complie as the intent is clear.\\
Peep hole optimization "Replacing instructions with more efficient instructions", which is the last step in complier optimization applies to both.

    
So, back to our question why FORTRAN code can be parallelized? It because it doesn't have pointers which mean no variables could point to the same memory location so no ``race'' conditions happen and the parallel must be equal the sequential. Example codes include:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++]
    void matrixvec(float *m, float *v, float *r, int x, int y){
        // A code that does matrix vec multiplication
    }
\end{lstlisting}
Although this code is ``Embarrassingly parallel'', speed up is linear with number of added nodes, since loops results are independent. The complier can't fully guess whether there is some dependency or not. The complier can be informed to treat them as independent by using the `restrict' keyword. 

Complier usually try to find such cases by disambiguating pointers, pointer analysis, alias analysis, nested loop optimizations, inter-procedural analysis, flow sensitivity, unification, path sensitivity, branch prediction, etc.

\subsubsection*{Quote:}
``Good Ideas might have ramifications" -- A scheme common in our course.

\subsubsection*{Note:}
    Path sensitivity is not scalable and cases $2^n$ explsoin. 
    Ex: 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++]
    if ()
        if()
            if()
                if() 
\end{lstlisting}
FORTRAN is a High level language fpr scientists.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Portable
    \item Readable
    \item Fast
\end{enumerate}
\section{LISP}
Symbolic data structures:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Supports list 
    \item Nested
    \item Heterogenous
\end{enumerate}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=lisp]
    ("Hello" 5 (name "emery" "height" 64)) \\looks like json
\end{lstlisting}
LISP supports linked list out of the box. FORTRAN don't support pointers and hence linked list is not supported. The language can be used to implement linked list by using offset list as shown bellow.
\fig{3}{0.6}{Offset List}{offsetlist.drawio.png}
\subsubsection*{Note:}
LISP was used to build ``SHRDLU'' an NLP and 3D simulator tool.

\section{Garbage Collection}
Garbage collection is the automation of memory management. The two main techniques are 1) Reference Counting and 2) Mark-Sweep.


\subsection{Reference Counting}
This is a method is a continuos way of Garbage Collection. 

\fig{4}{0.6}{Offset List}{refcounting.drawio.png}
RC can leak memory in the case of cycles. In the next example, when X is removed the branch it was pointing to should be removed. 

\fig{5}{0.6}{Reference Counting Can leak memory}{rc_leak.drawio.png}

\subsection{Mark-Sweep}
The mark-sweep GC works by reiterating over all allocated memory objects and marking as reachable or not. As shown in figure 3.2.

Python used Reference Counting and Mark-Sweep.
\subsection*{GC languages}
Java, C\#, GO, Lisp, ruby, DART, Python, Kotlin, TCL, Swift, OCamel, Perl, Modula, ADA.
\subsection*{Non-GC languages}
RUST, C/C++, FORTRAN, ALGOL, PASCAL.
